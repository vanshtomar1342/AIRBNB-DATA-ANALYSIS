# AIRBNB-DATA-ANALYSIS
Problem Statement
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data that can be analyzed and used for business decisions, understanding the customers’ and hosts’ behaviour, performance of the platform, expansion of the business, improving quality of places, and understanding clients’ mindset for a place to live in.

The dataset has been provided with 49,000 observations and 16 variables with a mix and match of categorical and numerical values.

Data Preprocessing
Some of the columns that did not give us much data insights and were not used for data analysis by us were dropped.
The reviews per month column had Nan values, those were changed with 0 because if there are Nan values in the review column that means those Airbnbs have not received any reviews that’s why it can be easily replaced with 0.
There were 0s present in the price column but the price of an Airbnb can never be equal to 0 so to make the data uniform we replaced the 0s of Airbnb price with median price of the price column.

Exploratory Data Analysis
It was found that Manhattan and Brooklyn had the maximum number of Airbnbs whereas Queens, Bronx and Staten Island had the least number of Airbnbs. It can be concluded that people prefer to stay in Manhattan and Brooklyn as these places could be more happening and these could have lots of tourist attractions as compared to Queens, Bronx and Staten Island.
It can be concluded that entire home/apartment and private rooms are more in number as compared to the shared rooms. Shared rooms are too lesser in number. It concludes that people prefer to stay in an entire home/apartment or private rooms as compared to shared rooms. This could be the reason because people always prefer privacy and solitude over money.
On an average the availability of rooms in Queens, Bronx and Staten Island is higher as compared to Manhattan and Brooklyn.
